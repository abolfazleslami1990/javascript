## About

This repository is a personal collection of JavaScript practice problems, algorithms, and mini-projects. The goal is to:

- Improve my problem-solving and coding abilities.
- Learn and implement new JavaScript features and techniques.
- Build reusable code snippets for future reference.

---

## Features

- Examples of fundamental JavaScript concepts (e.g., variables, loops, functions, and more).
- Solutions for algorithmic problems.
- Mini-projects to demonstrate real-world implementations.
- Focus on ES6+ features and modern JavaScript practices.
